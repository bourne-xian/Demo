#### Enable Source Link Symbol Server
This is used for step into 3rd party library, e.g. it will download the .pdb file from Nuget.org.

Disable Just My Code

Then we could step into 3rd lib: Behind the scenes, it download the source file from source code location (e.g. Github, Azure DevOps) .

#### Build Nuget Package that enabled Symbol Link

Edit csproj to build symbol package. The symbol package has extension with snupkg and it contains the symbol file (.pdb). So we could reduce the size of nupkg package which contains dll only. And source code is not embed into .pdb file, it's fetch from source control like Github or Azure Repos

![csproj file]([Demo/Update csproj.png at main Â· bourne-xian/Demo (github.com)](https://github.com/bourne-xian/Demo/blob/main/Img/Update csproj.png))

Publish the nuget to MyGet (it will upload the snupkg to symbol feed if it's in the same directory)  Another option is publish to Azure Artifacts.

Then we could debug just like we did for 3rd library.
